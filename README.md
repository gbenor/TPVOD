# TPVOD: Comprehensive Analysis of microRNA–Target Interactions

## Overview

TPVOD is a full Python package implementation of the research presented in the paper "Comprehensive machine-learning-based analysis of microRNA–target interactions reveals variable transferability of interaction rules across species." This project aims to examine the evolution of miRNA–target interaction rules and assess their cross-species transferability using data science and machine learning (ML) approaches.

## Background

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial in regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. This package focuses on the challenges and possibilities in the ML-based target prediction for miRNA, particularly across different species where direct experimental data might be scarce.

## Key Findings

- High accuracy in intra-dataset classification of miRNA–target interactions across human, mouse, worm, and cattle.
- Significant overlap in the most influential features across all datasets.
- The transferability of miRNA–targeting rules correlates with the evolutionary distance and seed family composition.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gbenor/TPVOD`.
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

- Detailed instructions on how to utilize this package for analyzing miRNA–target interactions, including example scripts and data processing guidelines.
